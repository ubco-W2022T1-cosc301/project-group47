# **Group 47 - Interpreting Happiness**

## **Introduction**

As international students from Brazil, Iran, and Egypt, we have all been exposed to different economies and levels of governmental support. We know first hand how it affects our well-being, and we would like to explore this topic further to understand this relationship on a broad, international scale. 

We hope to shed light on the type of policies which are effective in promoting well-being, and which countries have been proficient at it. Such knowledge is imperative to empower our generation to use our democratic rights conscientiously in order to enact change and build a future that can support our well-being as global citizens.

Another reason we chose this dataset for our project is the sheer variety of visualizations we can build upon it. We hope that with the advanced visualization tools in Tableau, we can communicate our findings in a way that is easily interpreted by others. Each team member had their own research question that they were interested to explore more into. 

Anna started off by determining the main factors that help determine a country's happiness score. Consequently, Yahia was exploring which countries offered their citizens the best living standards between the years 2015-2021, as observed by surveys conducted over the years for happiness score, social support, economy, freedom, and government corruption. Lastly, Darya examined how the average global happiness index was affected by economy, life expectancy, and social support between the years 2015-2021.

Exploratory data analysis is the crucial process of doing preliminary analysis on data in order to find patterns, identify anomalies, test hypotheses, and double-check assumptions with the aid of summary statistics and graphical representations.
