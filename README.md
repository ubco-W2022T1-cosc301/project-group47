As international students from Brazil, Iran, and Egypt, we have all been exposed to different economies and levels of governmental support. We know first hand how it affects our well-being, and we would like to explore this topic further to understand this relationship on a broad, international scale. 

We hope to shed light on the type of policies which are effective in promoting well-being, and which countries have been proficient at it. Such knowledge is imperative to empower our generation to use our democratic rights conscientiously in order to enact change and build a future that can support our well-being as global citizens.

Another reason we chose this dataset for our project is the sheer variety of visualizations we can build upon it. We hope that with the advanced visualization tools in Tableau, we can communicate our findings in a way that is easily interpreted by others. 

We would like to explore the following research questions further: 
1) What are the main factors that help determine a country's happiness score?

The dataset being used in this project was provided by the World Happiness Report 2020 and is published by the United Nations. The report was based on a wide variety of data, but most prominently on the Gallup World Poll. It is imperative to acknowledge the project’s current sponsors, which include the Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN), the Center for Sustainable Development at Columbia University, the Centre for Economic Performance at the LSE, the Vancouver School of Economics at UBC, and the Wellbeing Research Centre at Oxford. 

This dataset contains 12 columns and 1229 rows. Columns include ‘Happiness Rank’, ‘Country’, ‘Region’, ‘Happiness Score’, ‘Economy (GDP per Capita)’, ‘Family (Social Support)’ , ‘Health (Life Expectancy)’, ‘Freedom’ , ‘Trust (Government Corruption)’, ‘Generosity, and ‘Year’. The time frame covered in the dataset spans from 2015 up to 2022. 

The purpose of the data is for accountability and policy-making. This dataset exposes which countries have been committed to their citizens’ well being, and which countries have been neglecting it. Furthermore, policy-makers can observe correlations between the ‘happiness score’ and other factors displayed, such as GDP and social support in order to shape future policies and governmental investments.
