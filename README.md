<The purpose of this dataset is for education, transparency and accountability purposes. Global warming is one of the most pressing issues that young and future generations will face. It is crucial to use data analysis and visualization to communicate findings in a way that is accessible to the vast majority of our population. Only by raising awareness is it possible to spur change. It is our hope that this project will shed light on some of the contributing factors of climate change as well as the main players in the international arena. With a decade worth of data, we can analyze trends that showcase which countries have been responsible for the highest CO2 emissions, and which ones have taken the initiative to decrease their carbon footprint. Such information is powerful as it is accompanied by a strong sense of accountability. We are interested in this dataset as global citizens who want to enact change. We have the privilege to have access to such key information, and we hope we can use it for the good. >

The dataset used in this project was published by UN Data. Within this dataset, there are four files, each representing distinct variables: (1) carbon dioxide emission estimates, (2) threatened species, (3) water and sanitation, and (4) land coverage devoted to specific purposes (arable land, protected forest land, etc). Each of these data files contains 4 columns; the country, the year, the “series” (the variable under analysis), and the quantitative value that relates to the series. The earliest date included in our dataset is traced back to 1975, for carbon emission estimates. Our latest date, or the most recent data collected, is for Threatened Species during 2020. It is important to note that each of these 4 files have differences in the span of years in which the data has been collected for. A crucial aspect of this project will be to focus on the overlap of independent variables so that correlations between dependent variables can be analyzed.
