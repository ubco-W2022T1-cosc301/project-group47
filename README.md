The purpose of this dataset is for education, transparency and accountability purposes. Global warming is one of the most pressing issues that young and future generations will face. It is crucial to use data analysis and visualization to communicate findings in a way that is accessible to the vast majority of our population. Only by raising awareness is it possible to spur change. It is our hope that this project will shed light on some of the contributing factors of climate change as well as the main players in the international arena. With a decade worth of data, we can analyze trends that showcase which countries have been responsible for the highest CO2 emissions, and which ones have taken the initiative to decrease their carbon footprint. Such information is powerful as it is accompanied by a strong sense of accountability. We are interested in this dataset as global citizens who want to enact change. We have the privilege to have access to such key information, and we hope we can use it for the good.

The questions we want to explore are those which weâ€™ve had speculations about since the beginning of our project and ones which we believe will be feasible to answer given 
1. What are the countries that have contributed the most and the least to climate change relief? 
2. Is there a relationship between the decrease in forest coverage and the increase in threatened species? 
3. Do countries with a focus on agriculture (based on crop land) release more carbon dioxide?
