### **Firgure 7.** This graph does an excellent job of showing me the distributions of each variable as well as the correlation between my numerical variables. The strongest color intensity in the scale of a hexbin plot, which I used to visualize the answer to my research question, corresponds to the concentration of data points in that region. With the use of this feature, the overplotting issue that scatterplots face when there are a lot of data points is resolved. This information demonstrates the relationship between all the variables in my research topic that I'm interested in. The economy is predicted to have the largest correlation with happiness score, followed by life expectancy, as shown in figure 2 in the EDA section. Figure 10 makes it very evident that the relationship between happiness score and economy is the strongest, and that the happiness score has a normal distribution whereas the economy has a left-skewed distribution. A left-skewed distribution suggests that most of the variables are between 0.5 and 0.8, while a normal distribution means that most of the values in the happiness score column are quite similar and mostly around 0.5. Furthermore, it is evident that there is a correlation between happiness score and life expectancy as well as a left-skewed distribution of life expectancy. This graph indicates that social life is not significantly connected with happiness score because there are numerous outliers and the relationship is not very linear.
